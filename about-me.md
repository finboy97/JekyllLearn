# About Me

I'm a student, studying MsC Computer Science conversion course at Aston University. 

Prior to this I gained a first class BSc Politics and Economics.

My interest in computing comes from a lifelong interest in computer games and my experience using tools like Stata, R and Python for data analysis, which began when I studies Econometrics at University.
